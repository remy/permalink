<h1>Everybody knows that the dice are loaded</h1>
<h2>Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed</h2>
<h2>Everybody knows that the war is over</h2>
<h3>Everybody knows the good guys lost</h3>
<h4>Everybody knows the fight was fixed</h4>
<h5>The poor stay poor, the rich get rich</h5>
<h6>That's how it goes</h6>
<h2>Everybody knows</h2>
<h2>Everybody knows that the boat is leaking</h2>
<h3>Everybody knows that the captain lied</h3>
<h4>Everybody got this broken feeling</h4>
<h2>Like their father or their dog just died</h2>
<h3>Everybody talking to their pockets</h3>
<h4>Everybody wants a box of chocolates</h4>
<h5>And a long stem rose</h5>
<h2>Everybody knows</h2>
